Title: Installing the Software 
Date: 2018-07-02 

Before you start you will need to download some software. Pelican is based on python and github.io uses git.  

We recommend using the Anaconda install for python.  You can download the installer [here]().

Once Anaconda is installed you can use the installers to install the rest of what you need:

``` conda install git ```

``` pip install pelican ```

``` pip install markdown ``` 

Now you should be able to clone this repository using the following commands:

``` git clone https://xxx.xxxxx.github.com// ```
