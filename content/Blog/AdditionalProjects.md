Title: Making Additional Websites
Date: 2018-05-30 

###Github Pages allows you to make unlimited websites linked to other repository projects.

###For example, you have your main website *user*.github.io

###If you have a separate github repository *projectrepo*, you can make a project column by going to the 'Projects' header and creating a new column. It can be empty.  

![project]({filename}../images/project.png)

###Then, go to the 'settings' header and enable Github pages using the master branch.  

![settings]({filename}../images/projsettings.png)

###Now your html files in that repository should show up here:  
###https://*user*.github.io/*projectrepo*
