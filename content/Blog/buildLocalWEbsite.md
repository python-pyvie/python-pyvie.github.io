Title: Building your website
Date: 2018-07-01

Once you have installed the required software and downloaded the repository, you should be able to now get this site running on your local machine. First change to the msupelican directory and run the following commands:

```make html```

```make serve```

If the above doesn't work it probably means you don't have make installed.  You can use the following commands instead:

``` pelican content ```

``` cd output && python -m pelican.server ```

To connect to the local site you can use the following URL:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You are ready to start editing...
