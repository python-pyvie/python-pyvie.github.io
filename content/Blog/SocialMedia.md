Title: Connecting your Blog to Social Media 
Date: 2017-07-01

Your blog can be used to automatically feed information into social media sites such as Twitter and facebook. This post will show you how to connect your github.io site to [dlvrit.com](//dlvrit.com/), a service which can read your blog and post entries into your social media outlets.  

1. Create an account in [dlvrit.com](//dlvrit.com/) 
2. Copy the RSS Feed link in for your blog. 
3. Paste the URL in dlrit.com and connect your social media.

That should be it. You do not need to change anything about your pelican post.
